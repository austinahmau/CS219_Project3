In this project, we were tasked to read from our provided textfile following the ARM version 7 ISA format, implement the chosen operations on the registers or immediate operands, store the answers as an unsigned 32-bit number using **uint32_t** in the specified registers, and display what registers have been updated, the instruction the code will execute, and the result of the instruction that is store in the specified register.

## Installation
